NEARCITY is an ambitious project designed to revolutionize the way we experience the internet by shifting control from centralized corporations to individual users. It is built upon NEAR technology and NEAR AI, inspired by Web4’s mission, to create a decentralized, AI-powered, user-owned internet. The platform serves as a next-generation digital ecosystem, comparable to Google but fundamentally user-centric, providing personalized services while ensuring user sovereignty over data and identity.
